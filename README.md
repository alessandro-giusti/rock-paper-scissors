## Resources

*Activity notebook* contains the main code (notebook and realtime application), and an example of realtime video.
A conda environment file is available to setup a minimal environment for running `realtime_advanced.py`.

*RPS App* and *RPS Server* contain (unrealeased and pre-alpha quality) supporting software, i.e. an android app to automate data collection and its server component.

*Datasets* contain a number of datasets. A balanced 100-image testing set is included.  You are encouraged to add your own data.
